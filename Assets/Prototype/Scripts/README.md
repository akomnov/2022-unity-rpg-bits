This is a prototype of a way to use Unity Editor & run-time in a manner that lets us edit separate areas as separate scenes, but without duplicating any of the managerial stuff like global simulation, app state management and the like.

Since achieving that goal includes making decisions on how the app manages itself and its resources, this prototype will include a little bit of everything, i.e. input management, app state management, etc.
